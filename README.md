# Flow-Blocks
Open-Source visual node-based programming language for general purpose operations.

The current version is very unstable and un-usable.
The code is un-organised and not optimised, because this is just a proof of concept.

Current features:
-Constants
-Lists

-Arithmetic operators
-List functions (Sorting alogrithms and reversion)
-Boolean operators

-Bug-fixes

Todo:
-Better visuals
-Functions
-Cycles (for, while, repeat)
-User interface (for adding blocks)
